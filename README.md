## Geolocation DB

IP geolocation is done through [reallyfreegeoip.org](https://reallyfreegeoip.org). 
This means you will need an active internet connection in order to geolocate the IPs.

## Requirements

* requests
* tqdm
* colorama

## Installation 

You can install *fail2bangeolocation* via *pip3*:

```shell
$ sudo pip3 install fail2bangeolocation
```
## Usage

* You can run *fail2bangeolocation* directly from the command line interface:

  ```shell
  $ fail2bangeolocation [-h] [-c] {fail2ban,log,server}
  ```

* *fail2bangeolocation* arguments

  ```shell
  usage: fail2bangeolocation.py [-h] [-c] {fail2ban,log,server} ...
  
  Shows geolocation of failed attempts registered by fail2ban
  
  positional arguments:
    {fail2ban,log,server}
                          These options are mutually exclusive
      fail2ban            analyze all banned IPs by fail2ban (from fail2ban output)
      log                 analyze a fail2ban log file. Use "log -h" to see more options
      server              analyze all banned IPs by fail2ban (e.g. "server sshd")
  
  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c, --show-city       group IPs by country and city 
  ```

* ### Analyze all IPs registered by fail2ban 

  :warning: Requires root privileges  

  Run *fail2bangeolocation* using the *fail2ban* argument:

  ```shell
  $ sudo fail2bangeolocation fail2ban
  ```

* ### Analyze all IPs registered by fail2ban for a given jailed server/service, e.g. sshd 

  :warning: Requires root privileges  
  Run *fail2bangeolocation* with the *server* argument and the jailed server name:

  ```shell
  $ sudo fail2bangeolocation server sshd
  ```

* ### Analyze a log file
  :warning: May require root privileges depending on the file to be analyzed  
  Run *fail2bangeolocation* with the *log* argument and the path to the log file:

  ```shell
  $ fail2bangeolocation log /var/log/fai2ban.log
  ```

  You can also geolocate the unbanned IPs contained in the log adding the **-u** argument:

  ```shell
  $ fail2bangeolocation log -u /var/log/fai2ban.log
  ```
  
* ### Group the output by country and city
  Run *fail2bangeolocation* with "**-c**" as first argument:

  ```shell
  $ fail2bangeolocation -c {fail2ban,log,server}
  ```
